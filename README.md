# Security Audits and Incident Reports

Welcome to the Security Audits and Incident Reports repository!

This repository contains a collection of security audits and incident reports conducted on various fictional organizations, with some of the work stemming from Googleâ€™s Fundamentals of Cybersecurity course, while others are self-created scenarios. The goal is to simulate and analyze several severe, real-world cybersecurity situations, offering insights into how these scenarios can be handled.

Each report covers different aspects of cybersecurity, including but not limited to:

- Identifying vulnerabilities in systems and networks
- Responding to security incidents such as DDoS attacks, data breaches, and insider threats
- Conducting security assessments to evaluate organizational risk
- Recommending actionable mitigation strategies

These projects aim to mimic real-life security challenges that cybersecurity professionals face, helping to hone skills in both red and blue teaming exercises. They serve as a learning tool for anyone interested in the intricacies of cybersecurity audits and incident response.

Feel free to explore the reports, and use them as a reference or a learning tool for your own security work.
